This folder contains the localhost self-signed certificates and node.js server which you can run locally.

You can also generate your own if you would like to replaces these or get real certs from any reputable certificate authority such as our friends at [DigiCert.com (paid)](https://www.digicert.com/) or [letsencrypt.org (free)](https://letsencrypt.org/).
